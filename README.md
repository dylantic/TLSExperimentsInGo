## TLS Experiments in Go

For a bigger project I am figuring out how to extract and verify certificate data for a given domain. 
This is my unorganized sandbox and not actually guaranteed to contain flawless (or working) code.

Git is mostly my backup mechanism here but I didn't see much sense in not making the repo public.



Disclaimer: I am not catching errors correctly, sites not using a proper TLS setup will probably segfault or
open a gateway straight to the 7th circle of hell. Sorry.
